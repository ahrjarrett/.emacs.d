This is my Emacs configuration. =init.el= basically installs =use-package= and generates a file based on the contents of [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org][config.org]], where the bulk of the configuration lies.

Rewritten top-to-bottom on February 15, 2018 to support GUI Emacs.

You're free to use whatever you'd like but do so at your own risk. I do not assume any liability whatsoever.
